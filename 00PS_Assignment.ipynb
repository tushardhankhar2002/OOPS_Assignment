        "\n",
        "A1- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which are instances of classes. It allows you to model real-world things in code using objects that contain data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2- What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A2-A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the created objects (also called instances) will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3-What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A3- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a self-contained unit that bundles data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is created based on a class, which acts as a blueprint. An object represents a real-world entity like a person, car, bank account, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4- What is the differnce between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "A4-Abstraction = \"Don’t show me how it works, just show me what it does.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation = \"Keep data safe and private inside the object.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5-What are the dunder methods in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A5- Dunder methods (also called magic methods or special methods) are built-in methods in Python that have double underscores before and after their names, like init, str, len, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods are automatically called by Python in certain situations, and they allow you to customize the behavior of your own classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6- Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A6- Inheritance is one of the core concepts of OOP. It allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (parent class)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7- What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A7-Polymorphism means \"many forms\". In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), it refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8-How is encapsulation achieved in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A8-Encapsulation is a core concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that refers to wrapping data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9- What is constructor in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A9- In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize an object when it is created. It automatically runs when you create (instantiate) a new object from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10-What are class and static methods in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A10-In Python, both class methods and static methods are used to define methods inside a class that are not dependent on instance-specific data. However, they serve different purposes and are used in different situations\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11-What is method overloading in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A11- Method Overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but with different arguments (number or type). It’s a feature in many programming languages like Java or C++, but in Python, it's handled differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12-What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A12- Method Overriding is a feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13- What is a property decorator in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A13-The @property decorator in Python is used to turn a method into a \"read-only\" attribute. It allows you to define getter, setter, and deleter methods in a clean, Pythonic way, while still using attribute-style access.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14- Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A14- Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It lets the same interface be used for different underlying data types or class implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15-What is an abstract class in pyhton?\n",
        "\n",
        "A15- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. It is designed to serve as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes can define abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16-What are the advantage of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A16-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers a structured and modular approach to writing software. It helps developers build scalable, maintainable, and reusable code.\n",

        "\n",
        "A17-In Python, class variables and instance variables are both used to store data, but they have different scopes and lifetimes.\n",

        "Q18- What is multiple inheritance in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A18-Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This means a child class can access the attributes and methods of all its parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19- Explain the purpose of \"str'and'repr'method in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "A19-In Python, str and repr are special methods used to represent objects as strings. They provide different string representations for different purposes. str(self): This method returns a user-friendly string representation of an object. It is called when using the str() function or when printing an object. The goal of str is to provide a human-readable output, focusing on clarity and ease of understanding. If str is not defined, Python falls back to using repr. repr(self): This method returns a more technical and unambiguous string representation of an object. It is called when using the repr() function or when an object is displayed in the interactive interpreter. The goal of repr is to provide a string that can be used to recreate the object, or at least provide detailed information about its state for debugging and logging purposes.\n",

        "Q20-What is the significance of the \"super()' function in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A20-The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (or superclass) inside a child class. It plays a key role in inheritance and helps with code reuse and maintaining proper method resolution order (MRO).\n",

        "Q21- What is the significance of the del method in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A21-The del() method in Python is a destructor. It is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it’s garbage collected or goes out of scope).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22- What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A22- The main difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod lies in their interaction with the class and its instances. @staticmethod: It is a function defined within a class but does not receive the class or instance as an implicit first argument. It behaves like a regular function, but is namespaced within the class. It cannot access or modify class or instance attributes directly. It is used for utility functions logically related to the class but independent of its state. @classmethod: It receives the class itself as an implicit first argument, conventionally named cls. It can access and modify class attributes. It cannot access instance attributes directly. It is used for factory methods, alternative constructors, or operations involving the class itself.

        "\n",
        "Q23-How does polymorphism work in pyhton with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "A23-Polymorphism in Python means \"many forms\" — it allows objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface, especially when using inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "With inheritance, child classes can override methods from their parent class, and Python can call the correct method depending on the object, not the reference type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24-What is method chaining in pyhton OOP?\n",
        "\n",
